## Description

As part of our first-year exam project, we were tasked with creating a blog page using API integration. 
The required methods included CREATE, GET, EDIT, PUT, and DELETE. This project involved the use of 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, and Visual Studio Code.

We had the freedom to choose our own fictional client, and I chose my dog, Bilbo, as my client. 
This personal touch made the project especially enjoyable, as I was able to incorporate my own photos of Bilbo.
